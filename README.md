This uses [New York Times data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) to build timelapse videos for various metrics of the Coronavirus spread across the U.S., using a map format modified from an old version of [their page](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). The data of course only represent confirmed cases and deaths, not true cases and deaths. The areas of the circles are proportional to the number of people represented, although the scale differs between different videos. With default parameters, a given number of deaths will produce a circle with twice the radius or 4 times the area of the same number of cases would in the same category. The script uses a rolling average to smooth out values in the Daily video types. It uses linear interpolation to transition between days.

To run this locally you'll need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and the [Chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) on your path, and Chrome installed in the default location. It renders individual frames in html, so it takes a long time to run the first time (most of a day, with all 8 video types at 24 fps). On subsequent runs it only updates frames with diffs. It should be safe to kill the script while it's working and then start it again later, without losing progress.

Comment out lines in `buildVideos` to skip generating particular videos. Change the `scale` attribute for each video to adjust the size of the circles. Change `casesLookbackDays` and `deathsLookbackDays` to change how wide the rolling average is for the Daily video types. Change `framesPerDay` and `daysPerSecond` to change how smoothly and how fast the video runs (the product of these values gives frames per second). The script will remember images that it has previously generated, so it should take about the same amount of time to generate a video at 2 frames per day as it will to increase the resolution to 4 frames per day.
